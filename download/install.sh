# Block auto-start of feature daemons during apt install. The muros
# package ships every feature daemon (kea-dhcp4-server, unbound, snmpd,

# Daemons that need a per-site configuration must stay dormant until the
# admin enables the corresponding feature from the UI. Debian otherwise
# starts daemons right after package configure with their stock config,
# which is unwanted for HA/VPN units. The no-config services (Kea,
# Unbound, chrony, snmpd) are (re)enabled cleanly by the MurOS postinst
# right after, with a MurOS-managed config.
#
# We install a selective policy-rc.d that returns 101 only for the
# feature daemons. muros core services (muros-backend, muros-boot,
# nginx, ...) start normally so the UI is reachable right after install.
# The file is removed at the end of the script (and a trap covers

# it keeps whatever state it had). We stop, disable and clear the failed
# status of every config-required daemon so a fresh install always lands
# on a clean "inactive (dead)" baseline for those. The admin re-enables
# each from the UI once configured.
#
# Note: kea-dhcp4-server, unbound, snmpd, chrony and fail2ban are
